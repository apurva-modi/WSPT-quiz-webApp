English 101 provides additional instruction, guided practice, and individualized support to help students be successful in English 110 and navigate university literacy expectations, in general. This class is ideal for students who are unsure about their preparation to write at the college level or who have traditionally  struggled in writing classes. English 101 is a three-credit class and counts as an elective. English 110 is also a three-credit class and counts toward a student's general education requirement. This means that students who take ENGL 101 and ENGL 110 will take six English credits in one semester.</td>
                    <td>ENGL 110 is the best option for students who have experience writing and formatting papers that range between three and six pages, independently drafting papers in response to writing assignment prompts, providing feedback to peers on their writing, and revising their writing based on peer and instructor feedback. ENGL 110 students can expect to write at least four essays over the course of the semester. Students who enroll in only ENGL 110 (i.e., not ENGL 101) may anticipate needing some tutorial support from the Writing Center (all writers can benefit from getting feedback on their work!), but should not necessitate frequent individual meetings with the instructor in order to be successful in the course. Students who take ENGL 110 by itself will take three English credits in one semester.</td>
