            I <strong>pledge</strong> to support the <strong>honor</strong> system of <strong>Old Dominion University</strong>. 
            I will refrain from any form of academic dishonesty or deception, 
            such as cheating, plagiarism, or reporting inaccurate information. 
            While completing this placement tool, I understand that 
            academic dishonesty may take the form of inputting incorrect GPA,
            test scores, or the final grade received in my most recent writing class. 
            I understand that academic dishonesty may also take the form of enlisting 
            the help of someone else by either consulting outside sources or asking
            someone else to complete any part of this placement tool. 
            I am aware that as an admitted ODU student, I am subject to the same sanctions
            for an honor violation in this setting, as I would be for a violation of the Honor Code 
            in any other ODU setting. Additionally, it is my responsibility to turn in all 
            suspected violations of the <strong>Honor Code</strong>. <i>I pledge that the information I provide
            for this placement tool will be accurate, inputted directly by me, and generated
            with no outside assistance</i>.
